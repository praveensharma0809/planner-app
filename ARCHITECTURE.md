# ARCHITECTURE.md
## StudyHard — Target Architecture

**Version:** 1.0  
**Prepared:** February 28, 2026  
**Basis:** PROJECT_SPEC.md v2.0, CURRENT_SYSTEM.md, ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md  
**Approach:** Incremental evolution — no rewrite

---

## 1. Guiding Principles

This document describes the target architecture needed to bring the current system into full alignment with the product specification. The strategy is to evolve the existing codebase incrementally: preserving every working module that does not conflict with the spec, refactoring what needs to change, and adding what is missing. No module is discarded unless it directly contradicts a core product rule.

The three non-negotiable architectural constraints are:
- **Blueprint before generation** — the planning engine is a two-phase pipeline: feasibility analysis produces a blueprint for user review; DB writes happen only after user confirmation.
- **No auto-mutations** — the engine never silently adjusts user data. Every change to the plan requires explicit user action.
- **Past data is sacred** — the system never modifies or deletes tasks whose `scheduled_date` is before today.

---

## 2. What Stays Unchanged

The following modules are correct as implemented. They require no structural changes.

| Module | Location | Reason to Preserve |
|---|---|---|
| Supabase Auth | Supabase-managed | Fully functional; email/password auth matches spec |
| Browser Supabase client | `lib/supabase.ts` | No changes needed |
| Server Supabase client | `lib/supabase/server.ts` | Cookie-based server client is correct pattern |
| Task completion action | `app/actions/plan/completeTask.ts` | Binary completion + RPC counter increment is fully spec-compliant |
| `increment_completed_items` RPC | Supabase DB | Correct behavior; keep as-is |
| Core subject schema | `profiles`, `subjects`, `tasks` tables | Core fields are correct; additions are additive, not replacements |
| `is_plan_generated` flag on tasks | DB + type definition | Correct distinction; used by regeneration logic |
| Regeneration preserves past | `generatePlan.ts` (partial) | The guard `scheduled_date >= today` for deletion is exactly right |
| Subject management UI | `app/dashboard/subjects/` | Add/edit/delete with cascade warning is correct |
| Calendar page (base) | `app/dashboard/calendar/` | Monthly view foundation is correct; extended, not replaced |
| Dashboard layout/sidebar | `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` | Navigation structure is fine |

---

## 3. What Needs Refactoring

The following modules exist but must be changed to align with the spec.

### 3.1 — `generatePlan.ts` (Critical)

**Current problem:** Plan generation is a single-pass function that detects overload and immediately either writes tasks or aborts. The `auto` mode silently bumps effective capacity without user knowledge, directly violating Core Rule #2.

**Required change:** Decompose into two distinct operations:
1. `analyzePlan(input) → BlueprintResult` — a pure function that performs full feasibility analysis and returns a structured blueprint. No DB writes. This is Phase 1.
2. `commitPlan(input) → void` — a server action that receives confirmed input, deletes future generated tasks, and inserts new ones. This is Phase 2, triggered only after explicit user confirmation.

The `auto` mode is removed entirely.

---

### 3.2 — `overloadAnalyzer.ts` (Significant)

**Current problem:** Computes a single global burn rate (total remaining minutes / days to furthest deadline) and compares it against daily capacity. This is not granular enough for per-subject feasibility analysis as required by the Blueprint Screen.

**Required change:** Extend to produce a `SubjectFeasibility` record for every subject:
- Required minutes/day for that subject given its effective deadline
- Feasibility status: `safe` | `tight` | `at_risk` | `impossible`
- Capacity gap in minutes (0 if safe)
- Suggested adjustment options (extend deadline by N days, reduce items by N, increase daily time by N minutes)

The global burn rate check is retained as a summary output but the per-subject breakdown becomes the primary output.

---

### 3.3 — `resolveOverload.ts` (Empty — Must Be Implemented)

**Current problem:** The file is an empty placeholder. It sits on the critical path between overload detection and plan confirmation.

**Required change:** Implement as a server action that accepts a proposed adjustment (deadline change, item count change, or daily time change for a specific subject) and returns an updated `BlueprintResult`. It does not write to the DB — it recomputes the blueprint from the modified inputs and returns it to the client for display. The conflict resolution loop is driven by the UI calling this action repeatedly until the user is satisfied.

---

### 3.4 — `scheduler.ts` (Moderate)

**Current problem:** The day-filling loop assumes every day from today to the furthest deadline is available. It does not accept off-days. It does not enforce the two-tier deadline hierarchy (subject deadline must not exceed exam deadline). It supports a capacity-override parameter used only by the now-deprecated `auto` mode.

**Required changes:**
- Accept an `offDays: Set<string>` parameter (ISO date strings); skip those days during distribution.
- Accept `examDeadline: string` from the profile; validate that no task is scheduled beyond this date regardless of subject deadline.
- Enforce that each subject's effective deadline is `min(subject.deadline, examDeadline)`.
- Remove the capacity override parameter; the scheduler always operates on the user's declared `daily_available_minutes` as agreed in the blueprint.

The core sorting logic (mandatory → earliest deadline → urgency score) is retained.

---

### 3.5 — Onboarding Page (Major Expansion)

**Current problem:** Only Step 1 (profile setup) is implemented. The flow does not continue into subject setup, constraint configuration, or blueprint preview.

**Required change:** Extend `app/onboarding/page.tsx` into a multi-step wizard:

| Step | Content | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Profile (name, goal, exam deadline, daily minutes) | Can skip forward |
| 2 | Subject setup (add subjects with optional detail) | Can skip forward |
| 3 | Constraint configuration (off-days, blocked dates) | Can skip forward |
| 4 | Blueprint preview | Shows feasibility; user adjusts or accepts |
| 5 | Confirmation → plan written → redirect to Dashboard | Auto-proceeds on confirm |

Each step is skippable. Skipping Step 4 proceeds with an unreviewed blueprint and shows a warning. The onboarding state is tracked locally in component state; no separate DB table is required for the wizard position.

---

### 3.6 — Dashboard Page (Major Expansion)

**Current problem:** A single component rendering today's task list and a minutes summary. Structurally cannot accommodate the 7-grid layout.

**Required change:** Replace `app/dashboard/page.tsx` with a grid-based layout composed of isolated panel components. Each panel is a standalone component responsible for its own data fetching (via server components or dedicated server actions) and its own empty state.

See Section 6 for the full panel breakdown.

---

### 3.7 — Route Protection (Moderate)

**Current problem:** Auth checks occur in `useEffect` hooks on the client, producing a flash of unprotected content before the redirect fires.

**Required change:** Implement route protection in `middleware.ts` (the file already exists). The middleware should:
- Read the Supabase session from cookies on every request to a protected route (`/dashboard/*`, `/planner/*`, `/onboarding/*`).
- Redirect to `/auth/login` if no valid session is found.
- Redirect to `/onboarding` if a session exists but no `profiles` row exists.

Client-side `useEffect` auth checks can be removed once middleware is reliable.

---

### 3.8 — Language Audit (Minor)

**Current problem:** UI copy and internal documentation use the word "students" and framing specific to exam prep.

**Required change:** Audit all user-facing strings in page components and replace exam/student-specific language with neutral equivalents: "your plan", "your subjects", "your goal", "daily target".

---

## 4. Schema Changes

All changes are additive. No existing columns are dropped or renamed.

### 4.1 — `off_days` Table (New)

```
off_days
  id          uuid  PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
  user_id     uuid  NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  date        date  NOT NULL
  reason      text  NULLABLE
  created_at  timestamptz DEFAULT now()
  UNIQUE(user_id, date)
```

Used by the scheduler to skip days during task distribution. Managed from the constraint configuration step of onboarding and from the Settings page.

### 4.2 — `profiles` — Additions

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `streak_current` | integer DEFAULT 0 | Running streak counter; updated on task completion |
| `streak_longest` | integer DEFAULT 0 | High-water mark for streak |
| `streak_last_completed_date` | date NULLABLE | Date of most recent completion for streak continuity check |

Streak state is maintained as an incremental counter rather than computed ad-hoc across the full tasks history. `completeTask.ts` is extended to update these fields when a completion event is the first completion of the day.

### 4.3 — `subjects` — No Changes at MVP

The flat subject schema is retained for MVP. The `parent_id` self-referential column needed for subtopics is deferred. The spec marks subtopics as "optional, fully flexible depth" — this is a Phase 2 schema change.

### 4.4 — `profiles` — Columns to Retire (Non-Breaking)

`qualification` and `phone` are present in the schema but have no place in the spec. They are not removed at this phase (removing columns is destructive and requires a migration), but they are excluded from all new UI forms. A clean-up migration can drop them in a future release.

---

## 5. Scheduling Engine Architecture

The scheduling engine is a pure-function pipeline. No component of the engine reads from or writes to the database. Data is loaded by the server action layer, passed into the engine, and the result is returned to the caller.

         - Redirect to Dashboard
```

### Key Invariants of the Engine

- The engine is stateless and side-effect free. It can be called multiple times during the conflict resolution loop without any consequence.
- `commitPlan` is the only function that writes to the database. It is called exactly once per user-confirmed generation.
- The engine never produces tasks with `scheduled_date < today`.
- The engine never produces tasks with `scheduled_date > profile.exam_date`.
- If a subject has no deadline set, `profile.exam_date` is its effective deadline. This default is resolved inside the engine, not in the UI.

### Boundary Rules

- UI components never query Supabase directly. All data access goes through server actions or RSC data fetchers.
- The planning engine (`lib/planner/`) has no knowledge of Supabase. It receives plain objects and returns plain objects.
- Server actions are the only layer that reads from and writes to the database.
- Client components that need interactivity (completion toggles, drag handles) call server actions via Next.js's `useTransition` / `startTransition` pattern.

---

## 7. State Transitions

### 7.1 — Task Completion

```
Task: { completed: false }
  │
  │  User clicks complete toggle
  ▼
completeTask(taskId) server action
  │
  ├─ tasks: set completed = true
  ├─ subjects: increment_completed_items RPC
  └─ profiles: update streak fields
       - If streak_last_completed_date = yesterday → streak_current += 1
       - If streak_last_completed_date = today     → no change (already counted)
       - Otherwise                                 → streak_current = 1
       - If streak_current > streak_longest        → streak_longest = streak_current
       - Set streak_last_completed_date = today

Task: { completed: true }  ← permanent; no undo at MVP
```

Completed tasks are never hidden from the UI. They are visually distinguished (strike-through or check state) and remain on the Dashboard and Calendar in place.

### 7.2 — Missed Task (Falling Behind)

No state change occurs on the task itself when a scheduled date passes without completion. A missed task is defined implicitly by the query:

```
scheduled_date < today  AND  completed = false
```

This query drives the Backlog Alert panel (Dashboard Grid 3). No separate status column is needed. When the backlog volume (sum of `duration_minutes` for missed tasks) exceeds a configurable threshold, the Reschedule Suggestion Banner is surfaced.

The threshold is a constant defined in the application layer (not stored in the DB at MVP). It can be introduced as a user preference in a later phase.

### 7.3 — Plan Regeneration

```
User initiates regeneration (from Dashboard or /planner)
  │
  ▼
analyzePlan() called
  → Load: profile, subjects, off_days from DB
  → Run: overloadAnalyzer (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
  → Return: BlueprintResult to UI (no DB write)
  │
  ▼
Blueprint Screen displayed
  │
  ├─ User makes adjustments?
  │     → resolveOverload(adjustment) called
  │     → Returns updated BlueprintResult
  │     → Loop until user confirms
  │
  └─ User confirms blueprint
        │
        ▼
        commitPlan() called
          → DELETE: tasks WHERE user_id = ? AND is_plan_generated = true AND scheduled_date >= today
          → INSERT: ScheduledTask[] from scheduler
          → Redirect to Dashboard
```

Past tasks (`scheduled_date < today`) are never touched by this flow, regardless of their completion state. Manually created tasks (`is_plan_generated = false`) are also excluded from the delete step.

### 7.4 — Individual Task Reschedule (Calendar Drag)

```
User drags task to new date on Calendar
  │
  ▼
rescheduleTask(taskId, newDate) server action
  → UPDATE tasks SET scheduled_date = newDate WHERE id = taskId AND user_id = ?
  → If newDate is in the past (before today), reject with error
  → No conflict resolution performed automatically
  → If destination day total duration > daily_available_minutes,
    return a warning to the UI (move is still committed)
```

This is a direct, non-engine operation. The planning engine is not involved. The calendar reflects the change immediately.

### 7.5 — Subject Deadline / Data Edit

When a user edits a subject's deadline, item count, or priority:
- The change is persisted to the `subjects` table immediately.
- The current plan in the `tasks` table is **not** automatically updated.
- The Dashboard's Plan Health panel will reflect the new data on next render (since it computes health from subjects + tasks dynamically).
- A recalculation banner may appear prompting the user to regenerate, but regeneration remains voluntary and user-triggered.

---

## 8. Dashboard Panel Architecture

The dashboard is composed of 7 independent panel components, each a React Server Component fetching its own slice of data. This prevents a single failing query from breaking the entire dashboard, and allows panels to be added or removed without touching each other.

| Panel | Component | Data Source | Key Query |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grid 1 — Today's Mission | `TodayMissionPanel` | `tasks` | `scheduled_date = today, user_id` |
| Grid 2 — Plan Health & Progress | `PlanHealthPanel` | `subjects` | All subjects; compute health client-side from fields |
| Grid 3 — Backlog Alert | `BacklogPanel` | `tasks` | `scheduled_date < today, completed = false` |
| Grid 4 — Mini Calendar | `MiniCalendarPanel` | `tasks` | Count per date for current month |
| Grid 5 — Weekly Snapshot | `WeeklySnapshotPanel` | `tasks` | `scheduled_date` in current week |
| Grid 6 — Streak Tracker | `StreakPanel` | `profiles` | `streak_current`, `streak_longest` |
| Grid 7 — Upcoming Deadlines | `UpcomingDeadlinesPanel` | `subjects` | All subjects, sorted by deadline |

Each panel has a defined empty state. No panel renders a blank box. The grid is CSS-based (CSS Grid or Tailwind grid utilities) and reflows at defined breakpoints.

## 9. Performance Considerations

### 9.1 — Planning Engine Is Synchronous and In-Process

The scheduling engine operates on in-memory data. For a typical user (10–20 subjects, a plan spanning 3–12 months), the number of generated tasks is in the hundreds, not tens of thousands. The engine completing in under 100ms is expected. No background job queue or worker thread is needed at MVP.

If subject count or planning horizon grows in future phases (multiple concurrent exam profiles), the engine can be moved to a Supabase Edge Function without changing its interface.

### 9.2 — Dashboard Data Fetching

Seven panels making seven separate database queries per dashboard load is acceptable at MVP volumes. Supabase connection pooling (via PgBouncer) handles this. If dashboard load time degrades, the mitigation path is:
1. Combine Grid 1 + Grid 3 into a single query (both are task queries for the current user).
2. Combine Grid 2 + Grid 7 into a single `subjects` load.
3. Introduce a React cache boundary to deduplicate identical queries within the same render pass.

No premature consolidation is recommended until a real performance problem is observed.

### 9.3 — Backlog Query

The backlog is derived from a table scan with a compound WHERE clause (`user_id`, `completed = false`, `scheduled_date < today`). This is fast with an index on `(user_id, scheduled_date, completed)`. This index should be confirmed or added explicitly when the `off_days` migration is run.

### 9.4 — Streak Calculation

Streak fields (`streak_current`, `streak_longest`, `streak_last_completed_date`) are maintained as incremental counters on the `profiles` row. They are updated at task-completion time in `completeTask.ts`. This avoids a full table scan of the tasks history on every dashboard load. The trade-off is that the counter can become stale if a task completion is undone (not supported at MVP) or if data is manually corrected. A repair function can recompute streak from the tasks table if correction is ever needed.

### 9.5 — Calendar Rendering

The full calendar loads one month of tasks at a time. Month navigation triggers a fresh query, not a full-page reload (client-side navigation with state). For months with many tasks (100+), the day-modal approach (only loading full task detail on click) limits the initial data volume.

### 9.6 — Row-Level Security

All Supabase tables enforce RLS with `user_id = auth.uid()`. This prevents cross-user data leaks and removes the need for application-layer user-scoping in most queries. Server actions must use the server Supabase client (cookie-based) to ensure the RLS context is correctly established.

## 10. Incremental Delivery Sequence

The following sequence is designed to keep the application working at every step. No phase leaves the system in a broken state.

| Phase | Work | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **P1 — Middleware Auth** | Implement `middleware.ts` route protection; remove client useEffect auth guards | Low — additive |
| **P2 — Schema Additions** | Add `off_days` table; add streak columns to `profiles`; add composite index on `tasks` | Low — additive only |
| **P3 — Engine Refactor** | Extend `overloadAnalyzer.ts`; refactor `scheduler.ts` for off-days + deadline hierarchy; remove auto mode | Medium — touches core logic; existing tests (if any) must pass |
| **P4 — Blueprint Pipeline** | Implement `analyzePlan`, refactor `resolveOverload`, implement `commitPlan`; wire up `/planner` page to new pipeline | Medium — replaces planner UI flow |
| **P5 — Onboarding Expansion** | Extend onboarding to 5 steps; integrate Blueprint Screen as Step 4 | Medium — new UI; no DB risk |
| **P6 — Dashboard Expansion** | Rebuild dashboard page as 7-panel grid; implement panel components and their data actions | Medium — large UI work; data layer is reads-only |
| **P7 — Calendar Expansion** | Add day modal, drag-to-reschedule, missed task indicators; implement `rescheduleTask` action | Medium — interactive UI; `rescheduleTask` is a simple UPDATE |
| **P8 — Settings Page** | Add settings page for profile fields, exam deadline, off-days management | Low — CRUD with existing schema |
| **P9 — Language Audit** | Sweep all UI strings; replace student/exam-specific language | Low — cosmetic |
