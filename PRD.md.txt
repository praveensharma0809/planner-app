A notes app

It IS:

A workload optimizer

A capacity-aware scheduler

A deadline execution engine

A mission-control system for exam preparation

1.2 Core Philosophy

Preparation should follow a disciplined pipeline:

Define → Configure → Generate → Execute → Track → Optimize


The system must feel:

Structured

Controlled

Intelligent

Data-driven

Serious

Performance-focused

Primary Identity (Phase 1–2):

Competitive Exam Weapon

Future Identity (Phase 3+):

Dual Mode: Competitive + Academic

2. Target Users

Deadline blindness

Inconsistent execution

Poor load balancing

No capacity-awareness

Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS)

TypeScript

TailwindCSS

Server Actions

Supabase SSR (@supabase/ssr)

Middleware session refresh

5.2 Authentication Model

Cookie-based session storage

SSR Supabase client

Middleware refreshes tokens

Server Actions read cookies

All mutations run server-side

RLS enforced via auth.uid()

Security Principle:

No client-side mutation logic.
